Task 1.1 – Bone Segmentation:
- Visualize bone image and mask using nibabel library
- Femur and tibia masks were segmented using threshold = 350 HU
- Used NumPy bincount function to count bone segments and to label tibia and femur mask
- Morphological operation to dilate and fill the bone mask
- Output masks: femur_tibia_segmentation_task1.1.nii.gz


Task 1.2 – Contour Expansion:
- Used Erosion to shrink bone and get outershell of bone
- Euclidian Distance Transform used to calculate points outside bone
- Then expanded contour by 2mm
- Same method applied to expand contour by 4mm
- Output masks: bone_mask_2mm_expanded.nii.gz, bone_mask_4mm_expanded.nii.gz 


Task 1.3 – Randomized Contour Expansion:
- 2 mm expansion performed using distance transform
- Two randomized masks generated using 20% and 60% random fill fraction
- Output: Randomized_bone_Mask1.nii.gz, Randomized_bone_Mask2.nii.gz


Task 1.4 – Landmark Identification:
- Tibial plateau surface extracted from slices 94–215
- K-Means clustering (n=2) + PCA used to separate medial/lateral regions
- Voxel spacing: (0.869141, 0.869141, 2.0) mm
- Visualize Axial view in 3d view
- Extracted the lowest point of depth (z) from each five mask

Reason for higher z point on medial and lateral surface

- I found the medial and lateral region properly and visualize it in 2d and 3d image they were separated properly, 
later on to find lowest point, i thought z max will be the lowest, later i realize , i need to find lowest z on the
surface, it got me time to know the anatomy of tibia mask. I realize too late to write a logic and properly find the lowest
point. Within a remaining time i tried my best to find the point still no logic worked and was returning none. That's why i am uploading 
worked logic.  That is the reason i have not found lowest point on surface.
I am really disappointed, for not completing task properly. I hope you will carefully examine my other works on task, I really gave my best.
